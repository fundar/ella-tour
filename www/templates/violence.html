				<h2>Political context:</h2>

				<p>Mexico<small>[1]</small> is a federal presidential republic. It is formed by 31 states and 1 city* (Mexico City); Aguascalientes, Baja California, Baja California Sur, Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Coahuila de Zaragoza, Colima, Cuidad de Mexico*, Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico, Michoacan de Ocampo, Morelos, Nayarit, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave (Veracruz), Yucatan, Zacatecas </p>
				<p>Elections held in 2000 marked the first time that an opposition candidate - Vicente Fox of the National Action Party (PAN) defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that held the power over 70 years. He was succeeded in 2006 by another President from the same political party Felipe Calderón who has undertaken a war against drugs but Enrique Peña Nieto regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. The global financial crisis in late 2008 caused a massive economic downturn in Mexico the following year, although growth returned quickly in 2010. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, high underemployment, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in the impoverished southern states. Since 2007, Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations have engaged in bloody disputing, resulting in a confrontation of drug-related homicides between the government and these cartels. As a result, there are over 26,000 disappeared persons.</p>
				
				<h2>Economy: </h2>

				<p>Mexico's $2.2 trillion economy has become increasingly oriented toward manufacturing in the 22 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) entered into force. Per capita income is roughly one-third that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal.</p>
				<p>Mexico has become the US' second-largest export market and third-largest source of imports and currently has free trade agreements with 46 countries, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements. In 2012, Mexico formally joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and formed the Pacific Alliance with Peru, Colombia, and Chile.</p>
				<p>Mexico's current government emphasized neoliberal economic reforms during its first two years in office, passing and implementing energy, financial, fiscal, and telecommunications reform legislation, among others. Mexico began holding public auctions of exploration and development rights to select oil and gas resources in 2015 as a part of reforms that allow for private investment in the oil, gas, and electricity sectors which has produced several conflicts among indigenous communities where these natural resources are located. Although the economy experienced stronger growth in 2014-15 as a result of increased investment and stronger demand for Mexican exports, growth is predicted to remain below potential given falling oil production, weak oil prices, structural issues such as low productivity, high inequality, a large informal sector employing over half of the workforce, weak rule of law, and corruption.</p>
				
				<h2>Geography: </h2>

				<p>North America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, between Belize and the United States and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Guatemala and the United States. The Mexico - US border cities of Cuidad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico and El Paso, Texas, USA include the maquila industry mainly foreign-owned assembly plants with exploitative working conditions, including low wages and long working hours. In this industry, there was a prominence of women as workers in the factories that changed traditional patterns of female inequality and sparked tension within the traditional Mexican society. As a result, in Mexico, over 36,000 women were murdered between 1985 and 2010 <small>[2]</small> in Ciudad Juarez, in the state of Chihuahua</small>[3]</small>. </p>
				<p>On the other hand, the south border is characterized by complex migration flows in Latin American countries and restrictive migration policies in Central America which have increased the illegal activities of traffickers who take advantage of the vulnerability of undocumented migrants, especially women and girls who are the main victims of human trafficking<small>[4]</small> Poverty and a lack of economic opportunities also increase the risk of women and girls being trafficked for sexual exploitation under false promises of employment in other countries far from their families and culture. This form of recruitment often leaves women isolated from any social network, which further increases the risks of exploitation and sexual abuse. In Central America, illegal networks established by organised criminals and the militarisation of the region to deal with gang violence have both had a negative impact on the security of women<small>[5]</small>. Reports show that between 2007 and 2010 more than 6,000 people in Latin America were victims of trafficking, with 50% either women or girls. Almost 51% of the victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation (which corresponds to the proportion of female victims) and 44% for forced labour. Large proportions of victims came from Mexico; in the Central American region from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua; and in South America from Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru<small>[6]</small>. However, the real number of victims is unknown due to the clandestine nature of this crime and the lack of indicators in public databases.</p>

				<h1>Background on Violence Against Women</h1>
				<p>Over the last two decades, Latin American countries have implemented several kinds of responses to the high numbers of domestic violence cases, and citizens have seen major advances in public interventions to tackle domestic violence. The continent has followed a shared human rights based framework with the adoption of the Belem do Para Convention in 1994. This Convention establishes a variety of measures to prevent, protect, address and sanction violence against women, which are adjudicated to the state. </p>
				<p>However, State responses have been strongly focused on conciliation strategies and criminalization of the aggressor. Both of these approaches are influenced by the surge of the neoliberal agenda and human rights during the 1990s on the continent. This led to a focus of state interventions on the individual level, by arguing that every individual case of domestic violence could be reconciled (mediation strategy) or sanctioned (criminalization). Through a second wave of reforms over the last decade, however, more comprehensive forms of legislation have been adopted. Today, ten countries in Latin America and the Caribbean<small>[7]</small>, including Mexico, have implemented a similarly comprehensive legislation (excerpt from the REP)</p>
				
				<h2>The case of Mexico</h2>
				<p>In Mexico, the leading statistical resource to measure domestic violence, the National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships (ENDIREH) indicates that in 2011, 47 out of 100 women had suffered some kind of violence in the household. This could either include emotional violence (43.1%), economic violence (24.5%), physical violence (14.0%) or sexual violence (7.3%). A ground breaking case was key to make visible the magnitude and gravity of the violence against women in Mexico.</p>
				<p>Between 1993 and 2003, at least 263 women and girls aged 15 to 25 working in the maquila industry were killed or disappeared in Ciudad Juarez, which revealed a systematic pattern of violence and discrimination. State authorities at the local and national level did not adopt any legal response to investigate the crimes which contributed to create an atmosphere of impunity. Victims’ groups, particularly mothers or relatives, scholars and feminist and human rights organizations widely exposed the situation of women in Ciudad Juarez through media,<small>[8]</small> and also helped to raise a national and international debate about the lack of responses from the local government and the federal State (Juárez Rodríguez 2014; Lagarde y de los Rios 2008). The 2003 Amnesty International report, called “México. Muertes intolerables. 10 años de desapariciones y asesinatos de mujeres en Ciudad Juárez y Chihuahua” has been a milestone for the international pressure that came not only from the international organizations or United Nations agencies but also from the US Congress, the European Parliament and the Texas legislature (Anaya, 2012). International and regional oversight resulted in more than forty reports<small>[9]</small> between 2002 – 2012 demanding the Mexican State to take serious and adequate responses to investigate femicides in Juarez and provide victims’ access to justice.</p>
				<p>The newly elected government included after 11 years the issue of femicides in Ciudad Juarez as part of the national agenda. As a first response, it developed an Action Plan that included 40 “concrete strategic actions” involving the creation of specialized public institutions that investigate and sanction the aggressors, the harmonization of domestic frameworks to protect the right of women to live a life free from violence, among others. One of this specialized units was the “Specialized Prosecution Office for Women’s Homicides in Juarez” (CONAVIM) created on 2004 as the unit responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes related to murders of women in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua and more important it will articulate the actions adopted by other legal units to succeed in the investigation of femicides<small>[10]</small>. In 2005, the House of Representatives created a special commission to follow up on the investigations of femicides in the country, the prosecutions of the cases, and to contribute with the institutional strengthening to prevent, protect and eradicate violence against women. This commission, led by Marcela Lagarde, a renowned feminist, elaborated a Diagnosis on femicide in Mexico<small>[11]</small> , generating reliable data on violence against women in each province. On this basis, the Commission also elaborated, with the participation of other Legislative Commissions (Justice, Human Rights), a law with gender perspective that would guarantee and protect women’s right to a life free from violence. The draft included human rights perspective from different international organizations like the CEDAW Committee, the OAS and the ICHR as well as Amnesty International. In 2007, the Mexican Parliament enacted the General Law for Women’s Access to a Life free from Violence.</p>
				<p>Besides defining domestic violence, the law also recognises other forms of violence against women, such as violence in the workplace or the school, violence in the community, violence in public/state institutions, and femicide as the most extreme form of violence<small>[12]</small>. Besides, the Law is unique in how it proposes to coordinate different institutions -the Public Health System (article 46), the National Women’s Office (article 48) and the Special Prosecutor´s Office also known as CAVI (article 47), at the federal, local and municipal levels- to prevent, protect, attend and sanction violence against women. Furthermore, it includes a protection component for women who survive violence, with a reference to shelters as a specific mechanism to do so. The protection component is the only mechanism dealing directly with women which seeks to ensure they understand the social nature of the violence, beyond their personal/individual histories). It encompasses a set of comprehensive and specialised services provided to women survivors, their children, and perpetrators, in order to address in a comprehensive way the impact of the violence. Based on this conceptualization, the shelters’ main objective is the satisfaction of women’s basic needs such as a confidential, temporary and free of charge space where they can feel safety from the aggressor. Psychological, educational, medical, legal and social work services are mandated to be provided to women and their children by specialized personnel (Sotelo Olivares & Lopez Blas 2011). In Mexico there are 72 shelters of which 34 belong to civil society organisations, 4 to private welfare institutions and 34 are public institutions. Of this total, 44 shelters were articulated in a National Network of Shelters (RNR), a civil society organisation established in 2004 to "provide security, protection and specialized services to women and their children who live at risk of family violence, and to share best practices in approaches to care."<small>[13]</small></p>
