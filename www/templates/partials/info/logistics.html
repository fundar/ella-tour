<h1>Currency and Exchange/Banking Services</h1>
<ul>
	<li> <b>The Peso</b> (MXN) is the currency of Mexico, 1 US dollar = 19 Mexican Pesos. </li>
	<li>
		<b>Currency exchange services </b>(Cambio de Divisas in Spanish) are available at Mexico City Airport, in Terminal 1 (first and second floor) and Terminal 2 (first and second floor). We suggest that participants exchange their currencies at the airport, as exchange rates are usually more interesting at the airport. However, there is also currency exchange services near the Hotel Genève, and most banks in Mexico accept foreign Visa cards (debit or credit) for withdrawal transactions with a fee. ATMs can usually be found everywhere.
