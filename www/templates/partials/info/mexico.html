<h3> Mexico </h3> 

<p> Mexico is a Federal State, formed by 32 states and of approximately 123 million inhabitants. Its geographical area is of 1,943,945 km2 of land and it is the 14th largest country in the world. Most of the population is found in the middle of the country between the states of Jalisco and Veracruz and approximately a quarter of the population lives in and around Mexico City, its capital. The official language is Spanish, although around 50 other languages are spoken throughout the country. Its currency is the Mexican Peso (MXN $). Mexico’s president has been Enrique Peña Nieto, from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), since December 1st 2012. </p>
<p> Mexico has been the site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations - including the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec. It was conquered and colonized by Spain between 1519 and 1521<small>[1]</small> Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three centuries, it achieved independence early in 1821. Elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PENA NIETO regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. The global financial crisis in late 2008 caused a massive economic downturn in Mexico the following year, although growth returned quickly in 2010. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, high underemployment, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in the impoverished southern states. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful drug-trafficking organizations have engaged in bloody feuding, resulting in tens of thousands of drug-related homicides<small>[2]</small>. </p>
<p> Mexico is a very vast and diversified country. First, its 10 million indigenous people that are part of more than 50 ethnic groups make this country an ethnic and cultural mosaic. Nearly nine million indigenous people have kept their language: 16.6% of them speak Nahuatl, a dialect inherited from the Aztecs and mostly spoken in the center of the country; 8.9% of them speak Maya, mostly in Chiapas and Yucatán; 5% speak Zapoteco in Oaxaca and Veracruz, and other 5% speak Mixteco in the same region<small>[3]</small>. This cultural diversity makes very rich and colorful handicrafts. </p>

<p> Mexico’s historical, cultural and natural wealth has been acknowledged many times by the UNESCO, who has inscribed <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/mx', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;">34 cultural and natural sites </a> on the World Heritage List and has declared <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/lists?display=default&text=Mexico&inscription=0&country=0&multinational=3&type=0&domain=0&display1=inscriptionID', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;">seven Mexican traditions</a> as Intangible Cultural Heritage. In this list, for instance, is the <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.visitmexico.com/en/mariachi-tradition-in-guadalajara-jalisco-mexico', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;"> Mariachi </a>, a traditional Mexican music, and the ritual ceremony of the <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.voladoresdepapantla.com/index_eng.htm', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;">Voladores</a>, a fertility dance performed by several ethnic groups in Mexico and Central America to express respect for and harmony with the natural and spiritual worlds. </p>
<p> The traditional Mexican cuisine is also considered an Intangible Cultural Heritage by the UNESCO, as it is a comprehensive cultural model comprising farming, ritual practices, age-old skills, culinary techniques and ancestral community customs and manners. Mexican cuisine also illustrates the country’s diversity, as it counts with numerous specialties, inherited from its very diverse states and cultures - the chocolate, the frijoles (beans), the tacos, the enchiladas, the quesadillas, the famous guacamole, the chilaquiles, the pozole, the mole, the barbacoa or the famous chapulines (grasshoppers)! </p>

<p> Another important Mexican tradition has been made Intangible Cultural Heritage by the UNESCO in 2008: The Indigenous festivity dedicated to the dead (Día de Muertos in Spanish). This festivity commemorates the transitory return to Earth of deceased relatives and loved ones. Mexican families facilitate the return of the souls to Earth by decorating their homes with flower petals, candles and offerings. The deceased’s favourite dishes are prepared and placed around the home shrine and the tomb alongside flowers and typical handicrafts, such as paper cut-outs. Since this festivity takes place at the end of October and the beginning of November, do not be surprised to see decorated skulls all around the city on your arrival to Mexico! </p>

<p> Finally, Mexico has very diverse landscapes and climates, from the very arid North, to the tropical South, passing by its famous beaches on Pacific and Caribbean coasts, The Sierra Madre, its famous mountains chains, and its volcanoes, such as the Popocatépetl (5 452m) and the Pico de Orizaba (5 700m), without forgetting its beautiful forests. This diversity makes it a very pleasant country to visit<small>[4]</small>. </p>

<h3> Mexico City</h3> 

<p> Mexico City counts 8.8 millions of inhabitants, 60km from North to South and 40km from East to West. Mexico city and its surroundings (Estado de México) gather around 20 millions of inhabitants, making it one of the biggest conurbations of the world (in competition with Tokyo and Sao Paulo). It is located at an altitude of 2 240m and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, in particular the Popocatépetl which is visible from the main parts of Mexico City. Its downtown historical centre has been classified World Heritage from the UNESCO in 1987 for its colonial architecture: palaces from the viceroyalty period, squares surrounded by arcades, Aztec ruins, and the majestic Cathedral. The capital is one of the most dynamic of Latin America, with its 100 museums, its concerts and world class shows, its manifestations, its street sellers and restaurants where people can eat at any hour of the day. This perpetual movement gives to the visitor a feeling of freedom. </p>
<p> Mexico City beneficiates from more or less 200 days of sun a year, which makes it a hot city during the day, but its altitude makes it a cool or cold one at night. </p>
<p> Coyoacán (“the place of the coyotes” in Nahuatl) –the neighbourhood where Fundar is located– is one of the most beautiful parts of Mexico City. Traditionally a place that provided asylum to national and international artists and intellectuals, this neighbourhood has kept its bohemian atmosphere, and with its paved streets and colourful houses, homes of Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and Leon Trostki (converted in museums, that can be visited), it became the “chilangos”’ (familiar name of Mexico City’s inhabitants) favourite place to go out for a walk on weekends. </p>

<h3> Pachuca</h3> 

<p> Located in central part of Mexico, Pachuca is a colonial town with beautiful baroque architecture in the state of Hidalgo. The state is named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, leader of the Mexican War of Independence. </p>
<p> In the 19th century, Hidalgo was one of the centers of the Mexican mining industry. Hundreds of immigrants from Cornwall in England came to work to these mines. The city is still home to many of their descendants. Today, the state´s economy is based on agriculture and industry. </p>
<p> The city of Pachuca enjoys a temperate climate, beautiful geography and parks, and several sites of historical significance. The city has a number of event spaces as well: the Convention Center Tuzoforum, located in the Ben Gurion Cultural Park has eight meeting </p>
<p> rooms that can hold 20 to 2,000 persons. Pachuca also a number of hotels perfect for all kinds of events, such as the Hotel Holiday Inn 106 guestrooms and suites and 10,379 square feet of event spaces divided into three halls. Pachuca’s Fiesta Inn has 114 guestrooms and suites, and four meeting rooms, the largest measuring 5,959 square feet. The Fiesta Inn has 114 rooms and suites, three meeting rooms, the largest measuring 5,959 square feet<small>[5]</small>.</p>

<h3> Puebla </h3> 

<p> Nestled in the middle of Mexico, under the imposing view of the Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl volcanoes, Puebla opens its doors and boasts its official titles: It was named a “heroic” city for being the site where Mexican troops’ defeated the French army in 1862 (Battle of Puebla); and it was also named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, what makes this beautiful city most proud is its food, one of the most emblematic and delicious in Mexico. </p>
<p> Puebla is one of the oldest Mexican cities. Its design, also attributed to angels, goes back to 1532. A pleasant climate and a strategic location soon made it the second most important city in Colonial Mexico. </p>
<p> On their route towards Mexico City, the merchandise of ships arriving from the Philippines would first go through Puebla, which slowly but surely assimilated artistic expressions from the Far East. This characteristic is reflected on the beautiful talavera ceramic vases, pottery and the tiles that decorate facades in churches, big houses, fountains, patios and kitchens. Another example is the legend of the “China Poblana”, an Indian princess that arrived as a slave on the Manila Galleon, and who designed for herself a beautiful dress embroidered with sequin, which today is Puebla’s traditional dress. </p>
<p> If there is a word that defines Puebla, then it is baroque. Complex flavors that seduce our palates, elaborated shapes that capture our sight, an irresistible mix of legends and stories, winding streets, fountains, gardens, craft markets, artistic alleys… and a view studded with the churches’ domes. So, it is not outrageous to think that Puebla is the place that angels call home<small>[6]</small>. </p>
