A new workshop, presented by Montevideo meet-up organizers Adrián Mugnolo and Santiago Ferreira, will guide you through the concepts and practical steps required to build a simple application using Ember.<br><br>Using a variety of coding activities, the workshop will cover the following topics: Ember CLI project setup and structure, templates and data binding, computed properties, routing, actions, components, add-ons, controllers, Ember Data, testing, and deployment. Don’t forget to bring your own computer! During the workshop, a handful of experienced embereños will be answering questions and helping with any issues you might encounter. Caffeine in various forms will be provided!<br><br>At the end of the workshop, Ember CLI contributor and author of “Ember CLI 101” Adolfo Builes, will be joining us for an open Q&A session. All questions are welcome! We’re interested in your continued development so, once the conference is over, we’ll be providing ongoing support through a dedicated Slack channel for all attendees.",
