        "<li> Be sure to use taxi services at night time. Likewise, always take a safe taxi (taxis de sitio in Spanish). These taxis need to be called, are from trustworthy companies, and are 100% safe. Participants can ask for a safe taxi in the hotel’s front desk. Fundar staff can also help you with calling a safe taxi. Never take a taxi from the street; these are quite dangerous, so please make sure to call one of these “taxis de sitio”.</li>",
        "<li> At night, avoid going out alone. It is preferable to go in groups of at least two people. Never talk to strangers, even if they look nice and charming. </li>",
        "<li> Please, be advised not to take out valuable belongings (cameras, Iphones, Ipods, etc.) in the street or in crowded places. ",
        "<li> Always pay with small notes, especially in small shops. Do not pay with notes of $500 pesos, unless you are in bigger stores, as it will be difficult that people have change. </li>",
        "<li> When buying local art craft or souvenirs in a market, bargain! Since you are a tourist, vendors will try to give you higher prices. Also, bargaining is a common practice in Mexico. </li>",
        "<li> Be sure to always carry Embassy/Consulate information, as well as Hotel (see the “Study Tour Accommodation Information” section), Fundar and ELLA staff information (see the “Emergecy Contacts” section)",
